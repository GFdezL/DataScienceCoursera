Stuff for class

This git and programming stuff is kinda annoying, dude... It might not be my thing, after all... but I'll try it, I mean, it's not like I'm calling it quits after only a couple of hours watching videos! But seriously, it's supposed to be a class, so I thought they'd tell me how to do things in a more detailed manner, instead of, you know, giving me homework and basically saying "Go figure it out yourself!" :/
